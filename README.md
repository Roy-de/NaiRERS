# NaiRERS (Nairobi Rapid Emergency Response System)
## Introduction
Kenya faces a critical road safety crisis, particularly in Nairobi, where the loss of 500 lives annually and approximately 3,000 fatalities indicate the severity of the issue. The lack of an efficient accident reporting system and coordinated emergency responses, exacerbated by inadequate technology integration, has led to delayed or unreported accidents, contributing to the alarming casualty rates. This project aims to address the urgent need for a technology-driven solution to improve accident reporting, enhance first responder efficacy, and ultimately reduce road-related casualties.
